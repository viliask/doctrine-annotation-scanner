# Annotation Scanner [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phramz/doctrine-annotation-scanner.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phramz/doctrine-annotation-scanner)

Annotation Scanner is a library to scan files and folders for annotated classes using doctrine annotations.
The only changed thing is access modifier of parseNamespaceString method to allow inheritance. That's because PHP 8 process tokens in different way.

Install
------

``` 
composer require viliask/doctrine-annotation-scanner: "dev-master"
```


It's easy if you use composer!

edit your `composer.json`

``` json
"require": {
    "phramz/doctrine-annotation-scanner": "dev-master"
}
```

or via command line

``` 
php composer.phar require phramz/doctrine-annotation-scanner
```

Known limitations
------

Your code has to meet the following conditions to make this library work properly:
- Follow the [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) conventions.
  - One classfile contains exactly one class.
  - The classfile is named after the class it contains plus `.php` suffix.
- Since this library won't do any autoloading stuff its up to you to ensure that all
  classes are autoloaded or manually loaded (e.g. by using `require_once`).
- Make sure that you registered your custom annotations via the `AnnotationRegistry`.
  See [Doctrine Common](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html#registering-annotations) documentation for details.

Examples
------

The library offers two different ways to find annotated classfiles:
- If your just interested to find out which files contain annotated classes
  you can take advantage of the `Finder`
- If you need to find the classfiles but want to access the concrete annotations as well
  the `Scanner` is your friend.

Now, have a look at the following examples ...

### Finder
The following example will find any classfile under `/tests` that contains either `@Foo` or `@Bar` annotations in 
property, method or class-docblocks.
You can access the search result by iterating over the `Finder` instance. For each classfile you'll get an instance of 
`Symfony\Component\Finder\SplFileInfo`.
For more information about the `Finder` have a look at the [Symfony2 Finder](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/finder.html) documentation.


``` php
<?php

use Phramz\Doctrine\Annotation\Scanner\Finder;
use Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationReader;

$reader = new AnnotationReader(); // get an instance of the doctrine annotation reader
$finder = new Finder();
$finder->containsAtLeastOneOf('Phramz\Doctrine\Annotation\Fixtures\Annotations\Foo')
    ->containsAtLeastOneOf('Phramz\Doctrine\Annotation\Fixtures\Annotations\Bar')
    ->setReader($reader)
    ->in('/tests');

/** @var Symfony\Component\Finder\SplFileInfo $file */
foreach ($finder as $file) {
    echo "Found: " . $file->getFilename(); // will output for example "Found: AnnotatedClass.php"
}
```

### Scanner
The following example will find any classfile under `/tests` that contains either `@Foo` or `@Bar` annotations in
property, method or class-docblocks.
You can access the search result by iterating over the `Scanner` instance. For each classfile you'll get an instance of
`Phramz\Doctrine\Annotation\Scanner\ClassFileInfo` which inherits from `Symfony\Component\Finder\SplFileInfo` but
additionally offers access to the annotations of the class.

``` php
<?php

use Phramz\Doctrine\Annotation\Scanner\Scanner;
use Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationReader;

$reader = new AnnotationReader(); // get an instance of the doctrine annotation reader
$scanner = new Scanner($reader);

$scanner->scan(array(
        'Phramz\Doctrine\Annotation\Fixtures\Annotations\Foo',
        'Phramz\Doctrine\Annotation\Fixtures\Annotations\Bar'
    ))
    ->in('/tests');

/** @var Phramz\Doctrine\Annotation\Scanner\ClassFileInfo $file */
foreach ($scanner as $file) {
    echo "Found: " . $file->getFilename();    // will output for example "Found: AnnotatedClass.php"
    echo "Class: " . $file->getClassName();   // will output for example
                                              // "Class: Phramz\Annotation\AnnotatedClass"
    print_r($file->getClassAnnotations());    // will give you an array of all annotations
                                              // in the class-docblock
    print_r($file->getMethodAnnotations());   // will give you an array of all methods and
                                              // annotationss in the method-docblocks
    print_r($file->getPropertyAnnotations()); // will give you an array of all properties and
                                              // annotation in the method-docblocks
}
```
